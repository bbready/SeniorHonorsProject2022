Creation of BIFA (Bready's International Football App), an R shiny app for documenting and modeling outcomes of global soccer games

The app can be accessed via https://stlawu.shinyapps.io/BIFA/

Data is web scraped from transfermarkt live with each run, contains up to date standings for any of Europe's top 25 leagues and the MLS. Calculates live RPI for any teams in desired league and season, as well as BIFA rankings, based on offensive and defensive rankings for each team.

As a note, the BIFA rankings and forecasts tabs are currently down as transfermarkt updated its website formatting since the app was created (2022). Readme will be updated when the links are live and working again.
